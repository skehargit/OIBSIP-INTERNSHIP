# OIBSIP-INTERNSHIP

Welcome to my internship project! During my time here, I completed three projects - a calculator, a tribute page, and a to-do list. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I honed my web development skills and gained practical experience. Check out my projects and see what I've learned!
